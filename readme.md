## Project Background

In line with the event management company's stipulation for a "first of its kind" event with "a lot of impact", we will seek to identify an artist with recent success, and a considerable following, that has either never performed in Sheffield, or not performed in Sheffield recently, by procuring, collating and analysing data on chart performance, social media presence and subscription figures, and past and future concert activity. The analysis should include criteria to rule out unrealistic targets.

The potential event's dates will be selected from the datasets of future and past events, which include information on dates, artists, venues and ticket prices. The availability of the artist should also be taken into account, and whether other planned events could affect the volume of tickets to be sold.

After a date has been identified, we will then compile a list of venues available on this day and use mapping software to overlay these on a map of Sheffield. We will then create a heat map of Sheffield transport links. A list of venues which are located close to a sufficient number of transport links will be compiled and then compared by capacity.

After the choice of artist, date and venue, an assessment of profit is needed. Peak Analytics will estimate all the costs involved, such as the artist's fee and venue rental costs. From datasets on previous events a prediction of the number of tickets to be sold and ticket prices will be carried out so Peak Analytics will estimate the revenue from tickets and merchandise and calculate the expected net profit.
A final recommendation will be made when all the data has been collected and the chosen artist suitable for the venue available on a selected day is known. An additional benefit related to social impact of the event will be done, estimated through the number of followers on Instagram and the number of tweets within a week after the event.

## Methodology

**Selection of artist**
A dataset will be built combining data retrieved from MusicBrainz, YouTube, Spotify, Songkick, Facebook and Twitter via APIs and/or web-scraping techniques. MusicBrainz provides a list of URLs, including social media links, for each artist, so can be used to produce a table collating each artist's profile names/IDs on different platforms.

**Selection of venue**
We will need data on venues for hire (pubs, clubs, etc.) along with information for bus stops, tram stops, car parks and taxi ranks. Unfortunately Sheffield City Council do not publish this as part of their open data so Peak Analytics have submitted a Freedom Of Information request, which will be completed by 18th March 2019. Some of the data is already freely available.

**Selection of date**
Datasets on future and past events can be obtained from the following sources:

##### Question two: Recommended venue 
1. What are the top 5 Sheffield venues with a capacity over 1,000 by music events per month in 2019?
2. What is the breakdown of performances by the recommended artists at venues with a similar capacity to that of each of top 5 Sheffield venues for 2018?

##### Question three: Recommended date
1. What are the incoming events for recommended artists?
2. What are the incoming events in Sheffield for 2019?

##### Question four: Recommended safety
1. What is month-by-month breakdown of crime incidents occurring at Sheffield arenas** for 2016-2018?
2. What are the crime rates for recommended venues?

##### Question five: Recommended revenue
1. What is the average price for recommended event (venue, artist)?
